# Cayenne
Cayenne is a WIP physics/game engine that can be used to create games and desktop applications, primarily being developed by two undergraduate students in computer science as a passion project. The goal of this project is to create an easy to use lightweight game engine for use in C++ for use in future applications/games.

### Build System
Cayenne uses the CMake build system and should work perfectly with any ide that supports CMake. If you do not use an ide you (likely) already know what you're doing.

### Platforms
Cayenne currently supports Windows 10 by default but there are intentions to add Linux support in the future.

### Releases
There is currently no released version of Cayenne as it is still in a very early stage of development, however we will add releases to the 'Releases' section of this repository as soon as we have reached a state of completion that we deem useful enough. You are welcome to tweak with the alpha version however using the CMakeLists.txt project file.
